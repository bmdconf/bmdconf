The Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference is held every three years. The
first conference was held in Delft, Netherlands in 2010. The aim of this
symposium is to bring together leading scientists and researchers in the field
of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics and control, in a broad sense.

Topics include but are not limited to: bicycles, motorcycles, unicycles, single
track vehicles, modeling, kinematics and dynamics, control, human control,
rider properties, handling qualities, tires, experiments, aerodynamics,
simulators, nonholonomic dynamics, robot riders, path following.

For an open sharing of information, the meeting is organized to provide as much
interaction between participants as possible. The format is informal and fluid,
with a single track of presentations and extensive time scheduled for
interaction, and the forming and sharing of ideas.

**BMD 2026 will be held in Hamamatsu, Japan with Tomoya Kitani at Shizuoka
University as the organizer. More info will be posted in the coming months.**
